# cdm_xporter

pull_from_cdm.py is a collection of defs that pulls published data from a CONTENTdm repository.  Nearly all of a cdm repo can be pulled into xml through some combination of these defs.

An example of use is:

git clone https://github.com/lsulibraries/cdm_xporter/
python3 quick_Mingo_query.py

Development is currently halted until a use-case presents itself.
